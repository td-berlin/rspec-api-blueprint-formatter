# RSpec APIBlueprint Formatter

Auto-generate API docs from your RSpec tests!

Turn something like

````ruby
it 'retrievs the patients medications' do
  retrieve_medications
  expect(JSON.parse(response.body).length).to eql 1
  expect(response).to have_http_status(:ok)
end
````

with simple annotations to your Rspec tests into:

See the full demo [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nambrot/blueprint-formatter-example-app/master/spec/apispec.html) from the [example app with RSpec tests](https://github.com/nambrot/blueprint-formatter-example-app)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rspec-api-blueprint-formatter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rspec-api-blueprint-formatter

## Usage

RSpec APIBlueprint Formatter not surprisingly generates output that conforms to the [APIBlueprint spec](https://apiblueprint.org/). RSpec APIBlueprint Formatter makes some simplifying assumption and obviously falls short of manually crafted API docs. However, this can be a very efficient way to give your API consumers an easy to browse reference with basically 0 costs.

Effectively what the RSpec APIBlueprint Formatter will do is render tests you tag with `:apidoc` with their request parameters and response body and status. You will need to also tag your tests with (usually in parent context/describe blocks):

````
resource_group: 'Resource Group Name',
resource: 'Resource Name [/path/to/resouce/{id}]',
resource_parameters: { id: 'Description of parameter' },
action: 'Retrieve list of resource [HTTP_VERB]',
action_description: 'Some accurate, verbose description of the action',
example_description: 'validation errors'
````

There are some additional restrictions:

1. the `/path/to/resource` has to be unique across resources
2. the `HTTP_VERB` has to be unique within a resource

You use the formatter by specifying the `-f` flag `rspec spec -f ApiBlueprint` and it should print out the tests result in the APIBlueprint format. You can then use a renderer such as [Aglio](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio) to turn the APIBlueprint format into a browsable HTML representation. It is recommended to create a rake task a la:

````ruby
task generate_api_docs: :environment do
  `rspec spec --tag apidoc -f ApiBlueprint --out spec/apispec.md`
  `aglio -i spec/apispec.md -o spec/apispec.html`
end
````

## Configuration

```ruby
ApiBlueprint.configure do |configuration|
  configuration.output_source = true    # show source in output
end
```
